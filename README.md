# A Socket Template

I only use express and socket.io. This template is more basic than a typical chat app. I don't use middlewares. I only use jquery to facilitate.

## Getting Started

Fork it. Run `npm install` .

### hat tip to all o yall! stripped down tutorials from the docs. wanted to present something even a little simpler which still demonstrates the technology, and forms a strong foundation to build upon.
